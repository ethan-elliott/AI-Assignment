## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Summary

This notebook performs EDA on the `creditcard.csv` dataset to understand the data, clean it, and explore patterns related to fraud.

**Key Steps:**

1. **Load Data:** Imported libraries, loaded the dataset, and checked its structure.
2. **Data Wrangling:** Checked for missing values and removed rows with nulls.
3. **Univariate Analysis:** Visualized distributions of key variables (`fraud`, `used_pin_number`, `used_chip`, `repeat_retailer`, `online_order`, `ratio_to_median_purchase_price`, `distance_from_home`) using histograms and countplots.
4. **Bivariate Analysis:** Compared variables against `fraud` using countplots, stacked percentage charts, and scatterplots to reveal patterns distinguishing fraudulent from non-fraudulent transactions.

This EDA provides a clear view of feature distributions and relationships, highlighting potential indicators of fraud and preparing the dataset for further analysis or modeling.
